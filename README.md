## Overview
OpenMusicPlayer is a flexible, event-driven music player system for Unity that provides robust playlist management, playback control, and seamless UI integration. Designed for both simple implementations and complex audio systems, it's perfect for games, simulations, and VR experiences.
## Features
* üéµ Dynamic playlist management with ScriptableObjects
* üîÑ Multiple playback modes (loop, shuffle, sequential)
* üéöÔ∏è Volume control with smooth transitions
* üéõÔ∏è UI integration with visual feedback
* üöÄ Event-driven architecture for easy extensibility
* üì¶ Plug-and-play prefab system
* üéÆ VR-ready design

## Installation
Add to your Unity project via UPM:
```shell
openupm add https://github.com/yourusername/OpenMusicPlayer.git
```
## Quick Start
1. Create a Playlist
   - Right-click in Project window ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Audio ‚Üí Music Playlist
   - Add songs and configure settings
2. Add to Scene
   - Drag MusicPlayerCore.prefab into your scene.
   - Assign your playlist in the Inspector.
3. Add UI
   - Use the included MusicPlayerUI.prefab or create your own.
   - Connect UI elements to the MusicPlayerCore events
4. Control Playback
    ```csharp
    // In your game code
    MusicPlayerCore player = FindObjectOfType<MusicPlayerCore>();
    player.Play();
    player.NextTrack();
    player.SetVolume(0.7f);
    ```

## Best Practices
1. **Use ScriptableObjects** for playlist management - makes it easy to swap playlists.
2. **Subscribe to events** rather than polling for state changes.
3. **Use the default song** to show "no music" state in UI.
4. **Adjust progressUpdateInterval** based on performance needs.
5. **Use volumeDelta** for consistent volume steps.

## Advanced Usage
### Custom UI Implementation
```csharp
public class CustomPlayerUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Image playIcon;
    [SerializeField] private Slider progressBar;
    
    private MusicPlayerCore player;
    
    void Start()
    {
        player = FindObjectOfType<MusicPlayerCore>();
        player.OnPlaybackStateChanged += state => {
            playIcon.color = state == PlaybackState.Playing ? Color.green : Color.white;
        };
        
        player.OnPlaybackProgress += progress => {
            progressBar.value = progress;
        };
    }
}
```
### Playlist Management
```csharp
// Create playlist at runtime
MusicPlaylistScriptableObject runtimePlaylist = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<MusicPlaylistScriptableObject>();
runtimePlaylist.songs = new List<Song>(customSongs);
player.LoadPlaylist(runtimePlaylist);

// Add songs dynamically
player.AddSong(new Song {
    title = "New Song",
    artist = "Artist",
    clip = newAudioClip
});
```
### VR Integration Example
```csharp
public class VRMusicController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private XRController controller;
    [SerializeField] private MusicPlayerCore player;
    
    void Update()
    {
        if(controller.inputDevice.TryGetFeatureValue(CommonUsages.primaryButton, out bool pressed) && pressed)
        {
            player.NextTrack();
        }
    }
}
```
## Troubleshooting

| Issue                 | Solution                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No sound              | Check AudioClip assignment in playlist             |
| UI not updating       | Verify event subscriptions                         |
| Playback stuttering   | Increase `endOfSongThreshold`                      |
| Progress bar jitter   | Add `SliderInteractController` component           |
| Shuffle not working   | Call `GeneratePlayOrder()` after playlist changes |
